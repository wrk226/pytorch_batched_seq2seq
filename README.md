# pytorch_batched_seq2seq
This is the batched seq2seq model implemented by pytorch. The encoder and decoder are implemented by GRU.   
It is modified from pytorch official tutorial, [here is the link.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html)  
**Still need modified.**
